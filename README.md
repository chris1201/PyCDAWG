PyCDAWG - CDAWG in python
==============================

Introduction
------------

This is a python implementation of the CDAWG structure described in
"On-Line Construction of Compact Directed Acyclic Word Graphs" by
Inenaga, S. and Hoshino, H. and Shinohara, A. and Takeda, M. and Arikawa,
S. and Mauri, G. and Pavesi, G.

What does it do?
----------------

This implementation uses pydot (http://code.google.com/p/pydot/) to create
an image **out.png** that will show the created CDAWG.

To run use `python2 cdawg.py word$`

What's next?
------------

I hope to implement the sliding CDAWG as described in "Sliding CDAWG
Perfection" by Martin Senft and Tomáš Dvořák
